            FADE IN:<br> <br>
EXT. FOREST - DAY<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>An unconscious little GIRL around the age of 10 is laying in the middle of a dark forest. The sky is covered by giant trees and fireflies are flying around.
The girl wakes up and glances around, she’s spooked by the darkness around her, but she doesn't remember how she got here. Looking around for clues, she was only able to see a pitch of light glowing in a distance.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
When the girl finally gets up, she notices that the fireflies are flying slowly towards the glow. Her instinct tells her to follow them as the light is her only hope.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
She listens to her footsteps echo in the dead silent forest as she walks, but as soon as the girl feels comfortable enough, she starts running.

<br> <br>
FADE OUT.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
As the girl moves closer to the glow, it becomes clear that the source of the light has the shape of a skinny creature resembling a MAN. He seems to be resting against a rock and doesn't notice the girl is standing behind him. Startled by the sight of this fantastical creature, the girl falls backwards onto the ground.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The giant hears this and turns around, slowly walking over and holding out his hand to help her up.
CUT TO.
//Flashback// Medium shot of her brother holding out his hand to help her up at a beach, in the same way the creature does.
BACK TO.
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
Her eyes are wide open from the flashback.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The girl jumps up and hugs the giant. The giant pauses, then returns the hug.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The earth shakes for a second.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The giant turns his head sideways and looks into the dark void, he pauses for a second. Soon he realizes that the girl doesn’t belong in this world and she must return to her world, so he let go of her hug.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The ground shakes harder and the sky starts to turn bloody red. He grabs her hand and starts running with the girl towards the archway.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The girl is hesitant to go through the archway, and clings onto the giant. The giant leans down to pick a flower from the ground, hands it to her, and gives her a reassuring nod. The girl takes the flower and after looking back one last time, steps into the archway.

<br> <br>
<span style="margin-left: 30px;"> </span>
The girl wakes up in the hospital to the sounds of machinery beeping. She manages to sit up, carefully, then looks at her closed hand. She slowly opens her hand, revealing the same flower the giant gave her sitting on her palm.

<br> <br>
CUT TO BLACK.

<br> <br>
END.
